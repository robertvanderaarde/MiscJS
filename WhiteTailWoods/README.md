Finds open cabin dates in the White Tail Woods Cabins in MN.

To Run:

Go to the following URL

https://web2.vermontsystems.com/wbwsc/mndakotactywt.wsc/search.html?Action=Start&SubAction=&begindate=04%2F05%2F2021&rnwebsearch_search=Yes&nights=1&display=Listing&module=RN&multiselectlist_value=&rnwebsearch_buttonsearch=Search

Update the "nights, months, years" variables.

Months & Years should line up, so months=[1, 2] and years[2020, 2020] means search in January and February of 2020.

Paste the code in the console - it will print each day in succession.
If there are open cabins ( < 5 closed cabins) it will
print the number of closed cabins.
